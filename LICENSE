Please note that some parts of the source code are not licensed in terms
of the GNU General Public License  (see src/ui_gl.c).
This will change in future releases.

Note that you can use and distribute a fully functional version of these
plugins in terms of the GPLv2 using the gtk toolkit instead of openGL.

The main reason for this:
The openGL variant is still somewhat broken (threading issues related
to libcairo, libpango & libpixman with the custom thread of the openGL/X11
plugin UI) which need to be resolved.
Meanwhile the openGL version should not be distributed nor used in production.
